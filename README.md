## Description

**Safira** - fullstack training project based on [React](https://react.dev/)
ecosystem ([hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react), [context](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext), etc.)
and [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) in conjunction with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

**Main idea** is to develop frontend with minimum dependencies based writer on React.

**MVP** version would consist of frontend part with most used features of necessary real life e-commerce solutions and
backend with api, services and database.
